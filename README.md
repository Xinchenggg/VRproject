# VRproject

To be fixed:
1. Shooting frequency of controller

To be improved:
1. (DONE) Soften shadows to improve performance
2. (DONE) Random decal rotation along the axis, to make it looks like randomized
3. (DONE) Splash color base on ball color
4. Flies face point to camera
5. Hit count; shoot count; time spend
6. Throw and catch times without ball hitting ground

Good to have:
1. (DONE) Background
2. (DONE) Models
3. (DONE) Pick up object on hand, shoot when released
4. (DONE) FPS stats
5. (DONE) Add shooting target
