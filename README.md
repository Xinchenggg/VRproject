# VRproject

To be fixed:
1. Shooting frequency of controller(maybe ask matti)

To be improved:
1. <DONE> Soften shadows to improve performance
2. <DONE> Random decal rotation along the axis, to make it looks like randomized
3. <DONE> Splash color base on ball color

Good to have:
1. Background
2. <Done> Models
3. Pick up object on hand, shoot when released
